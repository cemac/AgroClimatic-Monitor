Brazil is one of the largest producers of many agricultural commodities in the world. 
Every year, the Brazilian agriculture faces droughts or extreme weather events, leading 
to economic and resource losses. These events are expected to be more recurrent in the 
future and understanding the risks and potential adaptations are key to achieve food security. 
Representing drought or extreme events in agriculture is challenging due to the vast 
spectrum of crops and management strategies taking place at the same time (e.g. sugarcane 
can be less sensitive than soya or irrigation can offset dry spells). This challenge is 
amplified in continental countries such as Brazil, where a huge variety of ecosystems and 
culture is found all over the country. 

Nevertheless, research institutes and government agencies in Brazil (e.g. CONAB, ESALQ, Embrapa) 
often generates state-of-the-art projections of the impact of weather and climate conditions 
in agriculture. However, most of the projections are difficult to be applied on a daily-basis 
decision making, as they are generated for large scale areas (e.g. State/Country’s production) 
or are still in scientific publications. The National Centre for Monitoring and Early Warning 
of Natural Disasters (CEMADEN) makes use of an integrated system of remote sensed and ground 
data to issue hazard risk alerts via online bulletins and stakeholder meetings. Yet, we see 
opportunities to add robustness to risk assessment in Brazilian agriculture and to facilitate 
communication to a wider-public that can make use of regularly updated indices of extreme 
events for decision making.

Therefore, this project aims on improving the representation, monitoring and prediction 
of the climate impact and its risks in agricultural crops. Our partner scientists work hard 
on integrating information from the space (remote sensing) to the ground (weather stations 
and census) to better inform risks of drought and extreme events in crops. Simulation models 
are applied to understand the main crop responses to the environment that can be used to 
draw past and future projections and adaptation strategies. 

This web app was developed by Brazilian and UK scientists and programmers from the National 
Centre for Monitoring and Early Warning of Natural Disasters (CEMADEN) and the University 
of Leeds, which aims in providing underpinning information to understand the climate impacts 
and disaster risk in Brazilian agriculture. This tool is aimed to help decision making at 
municipal level (e.g. Civil Defense) and growers that can monitor the monthly drought 
conditions of their locations. A full description of indices is given in 
our About the tool page.

about_us_textbox2_title = ''' What is CSSP-Brazil? '''

about_us_textbox2_text = ''' 

The Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) Brazil is a research programme 
that supports collaboration between the UK and Brazil, supported by the UK Government’s 
Newton Fund. 

It aims to develop capability to inform decision makers in climate mitigation and 
adaptation strategy and to underpin services to support climate and weather 
resilient economic development and social welfare. 

Our project is embedded within the CSSP-BR programme, and it's entitled: “Developing 
impacts modelling capability and understanding - Agricultural crop modelling and 
application”. The project is led by the ULeeds, with key partners such as Cemaden, 
Hadley Centre, UKCEH, Esalq/USP

about_us_textbox3_title = ''' University of Leeds - Climate Impacts Group (CIG/ICAS) '''

about_us_textbox3_text  = ''' 

The University was established in 1904, and is one of the largest higher education 
institutions in the UK. We are renowned globally for the quality of our teaching and 
research. The strength of our academic expertise combined with the breadth of 
disciplines we cover, provides a wealth of opportunities and has real impact on 
the world in cultural, economic and societal ways. The Climate Impacts Group (CIG) 
furthers understanding of the impacts of climate variability and change on food security. 
It's a group of physical and social scientists working together to define climate impacts 
on agricultural livelihoods and to develop adaptation and mitigation strategies. 
Founded in 2007, the group is part of the Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science 
(ICAS) in the School of Earth and Environment of the University of Leeds.

about_us_textbox4_text = ''' 

Since 2011, the Brazilian National Center for Monitoring and Early Warning of 
Natural Disasters (CEMADEN, http://www.cemaden.gov.br/), Ministry of Science, 
Technology, and Innovation (MCTI) is responsible for carrying out at the federal 
level the Monitoring and issuing warnings for landslides, flash floods, and 
floods. Besides, since 2012, Cemaden has operationally monitored drought 
conditions and their impacts throughout Brazil. Cemaden's drought monitoring 
system identifies affected areas and municipalities, which is a crucial tool 
to support risk management. The characterization of the drought events (duration, 
severity, and area extension) is also considered in assessing impacts.
